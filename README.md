# pairUp

It basically helps duos(pair of receiver and donor) find a compatibility score with other duos in which a person is willing to donate to the other person but is unable to do so because of incompatibility issues. Thus a duo can share the details of both the members and it will help them find a compatibility score with other duos to make an informed decision. Once the most compatible duos are matched, a medical expert verifies that they can now see each others' details and can carry on with the procedure.
